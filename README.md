# first commit of my new project #

###Oh! Gosh this is my FIRST readme :_D###

This is a website i'm making for a client. We're using a few js libraries and open source programs to make it possible:

* [link impress.js] (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored) to make magic happen.

* [Strut](http://strut.io/) to edit 3dChaos into Brainstorming code.

* [Gimp](http://gimp.org) to alter cold designer's PSDs and embue them with PNGs quitessential transparency.
