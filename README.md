# first commit of my new project #

###Oh! Gosh this is my FIRST readme :_D###

This is a website i'm making for a client. We're using a few js libraries and open source programs to make it possible:

* [link impress.js] (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored) to make magic happen.

* [Strut](http://strut.io/) to edit 3dChaos into Brainstorming code.

* [Gimp](http://gimp.org) to alter cold designer's PSDs and embue them with PNGs quitessential transparency.  

Strut build is located under `/strut.build` and the build of the site itself under `/html`, folder `previos` encases all content given to us by our designer, which is not yours to copy and blah blah blah.
the design is ***his*** and if you copy it ***his lawyer*** could be going after ***you***, ***my code*** is still open source and free to hack btw.
